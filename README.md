# sleap-io
Standalone utilities for SLEAP pose tracking data.

This is intended to be a complement to the core [SLEAP](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap)
package that aims to provide functionality for interacting with pose tracking-related
data structures and file formats with minimal dependencies. This package *does not*
have any functionality related to labeling, training, or inference.

## Installation
```
pip install sleap-io
```

For development, use one of the following syntaxes:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
```
pip install sleap-io[dev]
```
```
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Usage
```
import sleap_io as sio
import numpy as np

skeleton = sio.Skeleton.from_names(
    nodes=["head", "thorax", "abdomen"],
    edges=[("head", "thorax"), ("thorax", "abdomen")]
)

instance = sio.Instance.from_numpy(
    points=np.array([
        [10.2, 20.4],
        [5.8, 15.1],
        [0.3, 10.6],
    ]),
    skeleton=skeleton
)
```
